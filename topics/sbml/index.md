SBML (the Systems Biology Markup Language) is an XML-based format for communicating and storing representations of biological processes. Put more simply: SBML is a machine-readable format for representing models in biology. It is suitable for models commonly found in research on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulation, and many others.
